# Learner-s-Hub
An online web learning portal built on JSP and Java with Mysql

Learner's Hub is a Responsive website with a beautiful home page. There are two types of users to register for. One is a student and the other one is the instructor. Separate tables are created in the database to store their details. After registering, the student gets the student dashboard page and the instructor gets the instructor dashboard page where they will find the details which was entered by them during the registration.

Initially, the admin is the one who adds and deletes the courses that are to be enrolled by either student or instructor.

The Student Dashboard consists of :
Courses: where the student finds the available courses, only if at least one instructor has enrolled for that course to teach. If multiple instructors are available for a course then the student will choose one of them to enroll.
Registered Courses: displays the courses that are enrolled by the student.

The Instructor Dashboard consists of :
Registered Courses: Displays the courses that are enrolled by the instructor
Available Courses: Displays the available courses

The Admin Dashboard consists of :
Courses: where he will add, modify, or delete a course.

This project is just the outline of a real educational learning web portal like Coursera or Udemy. with a beautiful UI design.

Hopefully, this project will help individuals who are interested in building an online learning application.
